## About the Course
{:.mt-0}

This course introduces students to the design and implementation of operating systems.
Students will be exposed to a wide variety of topics, including:
processes, threads, concurrent programming, scheduling, memory, files, I/O management, and security issues.
The course will conclude with a series of advanced topics.

The course emphasizes "learning by doing," and requires students to engage in frequent discussions around design and trade-offs,
as well as programming-intensive activities.
Throughout most of this course, students will work together in small teams to develop their own operating system known as *Yalnix*.
