##  Fall 2020 Course Updates & MSU's COVID-19 Response
{:.titletext}
Information regarding our course and MSU's response to COVID-19
{:.subtitletext}

Our course is currently projected to meet in a hybrid/blended format.
What this means is that I will be present in classes for days that our course meets.
A subset of our students will be able to attend in-person classes, and all other students can tune in online via WebEx.
If you are unable to attend class in person or online, I will record our in-class sessions and post them on our course website later in the day after class ends.
Office hours will likely follow a similar format.

<!-- #### TL;DR -->
<!-- - Please **do not** come to class if you have a temperature or if you are not feeling well. If you haven't done so already, please contact your health provider. -->
<!-- - While we cannot require you to wear a mask in class, we ask that you do so out of respect to others around you. -->
<!-- - When you enter class and sit down at a seat, we recommend that you treat that seat/table as a contaminated. -->
<!-- - Please plan to bring your sanitation kit to class and wipe down your table before and after class. -->

###### COURSE-SPECIFIC COVID-19 INFO
- Office hours can be attended virtually by visiting my "Personal Room" on [WebEx](https://montana.webex.com/meet/w52k448).
- Feel free to schedule an alternative meeting time with me or the TA if you can't meet during regular office hours.
- We will primarily use {{site.data.settings.slackjoin}} for discussions and questions about lectures, assignments, and so forth.  
  _(I may also make email announcements via our course mailing list.)_

<!-- official language from the Center for Faculty Excellence at MSU -->
###### WEARING MASKS IN CLASSROOMS IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED
MSU wants all students to wear face masks or cloth face coverings in classrooms, laboratories and other similar spaces where in-person instruction occurs.
MSU strongly recommends the wearing of masks or face shields in physical classrooms to help mitigate the transmission of COVID-19.
The MSU community views the adoption of these practices as a mark of good citizenship and respectful care of fellow classmates, faculty, and staff.

###### HEALTH-RELATED CLASS ABSENCE
Please evaluate your own health status regularly and refrain from attending class and other on-campus events if you are ill.
MSU students who miss class due to illness will be given opportunities to access course materials online.
You are encouraged to seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness.
In the event of contagious illness, **please do not** come to class or to campus to turn in work or attend class.
Instead notify me by email me about your absence as soon as practical, so that accommodations can be made.
Please note that documentation (a Doctorâ€™s note) for medical excuses is **not required**.
MSU University Health Partners - as part their commitment to maintain patient confidentiality, to encourage more appropriate use of healthcare resources, and to support meaningful dialogue between instructors and students - does not provide such documentation.

###### DISABILITIES
If you are a student with a disability and wish to use your approved accommodations for this course, please contact me during my office hours to discuss.
Please have your Accommodation Notification or Blue Card available for verification of accommodations.
Accommodations are approved through the Office of Disability Services located in SUB 174.
For more information, please see: [www.montana.edu/disabilityservices](www.montana.edu/disabilityservices).

###### SOME MISC. HELPFUL LINKS
- The [MSU Bookstore has great resources available to faculty and students]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid19/msu_bookstore_covid19.pdf).
- MSU is maintaining a helpful page for students: [Students: Learn Anywhere](http://ato.montana.edu/learnanywhere/students/index-old.html).
- The [GSoC Student Success Center](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html) is still operating (virtually).
