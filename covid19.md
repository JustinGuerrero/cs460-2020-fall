##  Spring 2020 Course Updates & COVID-19 Response _(NEW!)_
{:.titletext}
Information regarding our course and MSU's response to COVID-19
{:.subtitletext}

Our course is currently projected to meet in a hybrid/blended format.
What this means is that I will be present in classes for days that our course meets.
A subset of our students will be able to attend in-person classes, and all other students can tune in online via WebEx.
If you are unable to attend class in person or online, I will record our in-class sessions and post them on our course website later in the day after class ends.
Office hours will likely follow a similar format.

#### Course Info
- Office hours can be attended virtually by visiting my "Personal Room" on [**_WebEx_**](https://montana.webex.com/meet/w52k448).
- Feel free to schedule an alternative meeting time with me or the TA if you can't meet during regular office hours.
- We will use _**{{site.data.settings.slackjoin}}**_ for discussions and questions about lectures, assignments, and so forth.
  - _I may also make email announcements via our course mailing list._

#### MSU Info
- The [_**MSU Bookstore has great resources available to faculty and students**_]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid19/msu_bookstore_covid19.pdf).
- MSU is maintaining a helpful page for students: [**_Students: Learn Anywhere_**](http://ato.montana.edu/learnanywhere/students/index-old.html).
- The [_**GSoC Student Success Center**_](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html) is still operating (virtually).

#### Procedures for Face-to-Face Class Meetings
- Please **do not** come to class if you have a temperature or if you are not feeling well. If you haven't done so already, please contact your health provider. 
- While we cannot require you to wear a mask in class, we ask that you do so out of respect to your peers.
- Please plan to bring your sanitation kit to class and wipe down your table before and after class.
- When you enter class and sit down at a seat, you should treat that seat/table as a contaminated.
